## Overview
This repo serves as documentation of code used by the routine reporting team to generate IM slide 1 during the COVID-19 response 
for the Case Surveillance Section. Intially, this slide (IM slide 1) was generated in excel but 
was transitioned to R during July 2020. Within this repo, each of these files discussed
below is also included as example input and output. 

Once all packages are installed, one can just 'source' the entire [script](https://github.com/CDCgov/IMslide/tree/master/code) to generate
3 different outputs after adjusting the date for the file names of the 3 outputs (L164, 
L294, and L381). 
Those outputs include: 

* 2 [png images](https://github.com/CDCgov/IMslide/tree/master/images) 
* 1 [excel file](https://github.com/CDCgov/IMslide/tree/master/updated.data) with updated information generated in R

The png images are [epi-curves](https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/outbreaks/investigating-outbreaks/epi-curves.html); one with correction to exclude high number of probable 
deaths reported during June (slide2). The input to generate these files is a csv file
consisting of 5 columns - submission date, total cases, new cases, new deaths, and total deaths.
This file was generated daily from DCIPHER and made available to those on the routine reporting team. 

This code was developed while on COVID19 response by 

* [Jenna Hamlin](https://github.com/jennahamlin)
* [Marcela Torres](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcela-torres24)

As of this writing and because we are no longer on the response changes may have been
made to generate these images, but hope that this repo could be helpful for others. We 
encourage others that are on response and participating in making these figures to 
provide addtional updates as they see fit.
